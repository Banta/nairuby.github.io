The **Nairobi Ruby Brigade**, also known as **nairuby** and **nai.rb**, is a
user group for Ruby programmers in [Nairobi, Kenya][1]. The group welcomes all
programmers interested in the language and its implementations, tools, libraries
and frameworks, such as [Ruby on Rails][ror]. The group has been meeting since
August 2011 for presentations, demos and discussions applicable to all skill
levels, from newbies and experts.

We're not merely a user group, but an open source culture incubator. Whenever we
can, we come together to share knowledge, projects, code and enthusiasm for Ruby
â€“ join us!

The **Nairobi Ruby Brigade**, also known as **nairuby** and **nai.rb**, is a
user group for Ruby programmers in [Nairobi, Kenya][nairobi-kenya-map]. The
group welcomes all programmers interested in the language and its
implementations, tools, libraries and frameworks, such as [Ruby on Rails][ror].
The group has been meeting since August 2011 for presentations, demos and
discussions applicable to all skill levels, from newbies and experts.

We're not merely a user group, but an open source culture incubator. Whenever we
can, we come together to share knowledge, projects, code and enthusiasm for Ruby
â€“ join us!

## Participate

There are many ways to participate in Nairuby:

* **Attend our meet-ups:** we have a number of regular meet-ups that
  everyone is welcome to attend:

    * **General meetings** for formal presentations, lightning talks and group
    discussions on topics of interest to those working with Ruby. Meetings are
    usually the first Tuesday of the month, _"Ruby Tuesday"_. Let us know if
    you're interested in presenting.

    * **Beginner's meetings** for one-on-one help. Programmers with any level of
    Ruby experience are welcome at these so they can get and offer help at
    these. Meetings are every week except the first week.

    * **Lunch meetings** to hang out and eat lunch with your fellow Ruby enthusiasts.
    Meetings are usually the last Wednesday of the month.

* **Give a presentation** at one our our monthly meetings and share
something you've learned in the world of Ruby with the group. You can also
suggest a presentation if there's something you'd like to learn or a speaker you
want us to recruit.

* **[Subscribe to our online mailing list:][mail-list]** _"nairuby"_ to receive
meeting announcements and notes, get suggestions of interesting events, and
participate in technical discussions. You may post information about Ruby
related jobs and gigs near Nairobi if you follow the job posting guidelines.

* **Contribute code to Nairuby's official homepage** _(this site)_. The [code is
publicly available on GitHub][1] and is powered by [Jekyll][2], a fun and easy
to use static site generator. Help us close [some of the open issues][3] or
[create new issues][4].

* **Tell the world** that you're part of this user group and find others to join.

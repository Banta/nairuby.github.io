The **Nairobi Ruby Brigade**, also known as **nairuby** and **nai.rb**, is a
user group for Ruby programmers in [Nairobi, Kenya][nairobi-kenya-map]. The
group welcomes all programmers interested in the language and its
implementations, tools, libraries and frameworks, such as [Ruby on Rails][ror].
The group has been meeting since August 2011 for presentations, demos and
discussions applicable to all skill levels, from newbies and experts.

This is the source code of their official website @ [nairuby.org][nairuby]
powered by [Jekyll][jekyll], a static site generator that's fun and easy to use.

To run locally run, `jekyll serve --watch --safe --trace`. To run Jekyll in a
way that matches the [GitHub Pages][github-pages] build server (useful for
debugging), run Jekyll with [Bundler][bundler]. Use the command `bundle exec
jekyll serve --watch --safe --trace`.

_Ps: This is just a stub to give you an overview of what all this is about, for
more comprehensive information, [nairuby.org is really where you should be
looking][nairuby]._
